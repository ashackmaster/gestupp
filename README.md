# 🌌 Gesture-Controlled 3D Model Viewer 

A modern and interactive application that allows users to control 3D models using **hand gestures**.  
This project demonstrates a fully interactive **3D Solar System** where planets and objects can be explored using natural hand movements—without a mouse or keyboard.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- ✋ **Real-Time Hand Gesture Control** using MediaPipe  
- 🌍 **Interactive 3D Solar System** with smooth animations  
- 🧠 **Gesture-to-Action Mapping** for intuitive 3D navigation  
- 🎨 **Modern, Responsive UI** built with Tailwind CSS  
- ⚡ Optimized for performance and low-latency interaction

## 🚀 Features

- ✋ **Real-Time Hand Gesture Control**  
  Control 3D models using natural hand movements.

- 🌀 **Multiple Gesture Support**
  - Rotate objects
  - Zoom In / Zoom Out
  - Pan / Move in 3D space
  - Reset camera view

- ☀️ **3D Solar System Model**

## 🧠 How It Works

The application uses a gesture recognition system to detect hand movements in real time.  
Each gesture is mapped to specific 3D transformations such as rotation, zoom, and translation, allowing intuitive control over the Solar System model.
